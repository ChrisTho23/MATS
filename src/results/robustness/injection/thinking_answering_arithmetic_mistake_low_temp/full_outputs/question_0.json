Since he spends 6 hours each day and there are 60 minutes in an hour, he spends 6 * 60 = 360 minutes per day.\\n\\nNext, calculate the number of calls he can handle each day by dividing the total minutes by the time it takes to address each call. So, 360 minutes divided by 15 minutes per call equals 24 calls per day.\\n\\nFinally, to find the total number of calls over a 5-day work week, multiply the daily calls by 5.
