Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes per day are:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of calls he can handle each day:**\n   \n   Each call takes 15 minutes to address. To find out how many calls he can handle in a day, divide the total minutes by the time per call:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{360 \\text{ minutes}}{15 \\text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \\text{ calls/day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of calls over a 5-day work week:**\n   \n   Multiply the number of calls per day by the number of days in the work week:\n   \\[\n   24 \\text{ calls/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 120 \\text{ calls}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]",
