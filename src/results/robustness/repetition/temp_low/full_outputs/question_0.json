      "full_output": "First, determine the total number of hours Tim spends answering phones each week. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work and works 5 days a week, the total time spent answering phones is 6 hours/day multiplied by 5 days, which equals 30 hours.\n\nNext, convert the total answering time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 hours multiplied by 60 minutes/hour equals 1800 minutes.\n\nThen, calculate the number of calls Tim can handle by dividing the total answering time in minutes by the time it takes to handle each call. Dividing 1800 minutes by 15 minutes per call gives 120 calls.\n\nTherefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of hours Tim spends answering phones each week:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total hours per week} = 6 \\, \\text{hours/day} \\times 5 \\, \\text{days} = 30 \\, \\text{hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the total answering time from hours to minutes:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total minutes per week} = 30 \\, \\text{hours} \\times 60 \\, \\text{minutes/hour} = 1800 \\, \\text{minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of calls Tim can handle:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of calls} = \\frac{\\text{Total minutes}}{\\text{Minutes per call}} = \\frac{1800}{15} = 360 \\, \\text{calls}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{360}\n\\]"
